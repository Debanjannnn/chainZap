# legacyON APTOS - SimpleWill Blockchain Will Contract

A decentralized will-like contract built on the Aptos blockchain that allows users to deposit APT tokens and designate a recipient who can claim the funds. This project combines a Move smart contract with a modern React frontend for a complete dApp experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

legacyON APTOS SimpleWill is a trustless, decentralized solution for managing digital assets as a will. The contract allows an owner to:
- Deposit APT tokens into a secure contract
- Designate a recipient who can claim the funds
- Maintain full control over the will until the recipient claims the funds

## üèõÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Resources

```move
struct Will has key {
    owner: address,           // Contract owner
    recipient: address,       // Designated recipient
    amount: u64,             // Total deposited amount
    balance: coin::Coin<AptosCoin>, // Actual coin balance
}
```

### Key Functions

- `initialize(account)` - Initialize a new will contract
- `deposit(account, amount)` - Deposit APT tokens
- `set_recipient(account, recipient_addr)` - Set or change recipient
- `claim(account)` - Claim deposited funds (recipient only)
- `get_balance(account_addr)` - View contract balance

### Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Uninitialized contracts
- Unauthorized access
- Invalid recipient addresses
- Insufficient funds
